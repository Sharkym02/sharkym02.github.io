WEB 200 SP24

I am taking WEB 200 in order to learn more about web development, specifically how to integrate scripts into your website. Last semester I learned a lot about formatting webpages through HTML and CSS, and delved slightly into inserting interactive javascript code into my webpages, but I hope to become much more experienced through taking this course.
