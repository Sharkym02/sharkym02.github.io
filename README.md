WEB 200 SP24

I am taking WEB 200 in order to learn more about web development, specifically how to integrate scripts into your website. Last semester I learned a lot about formatting webpages through HTML and CSS, and delved slightly into inserting interactive javascript code into my webpages, but I hope to become much more experienced through taking this course.

Assignment 1- I established a directory for all of my assignments as well as learned how to have javascript functions output text on HTML webpages.

Assignment 2- I developed more thorough functions that do many calculations using javacsript, and sending their outputs in various places.

Assignment 3- I learned how to take user inputs as my javascript functions.

Assignment 4- I learned how to create input fields in the HTML, and take those inputs and utilize them for my javascript functions, as well as directly display the javascript outputs as text on the website.

Assignment 5- I learned how to incorporate if//else statements into my javascript/html webpages, as well as how to use checkboxes to make my functions perform differently based on whether they are checked or unchecked.

Assignments 6/7 - I learned how to use loops in my javascript code, as well as learned what kind of applications these loops should be used for.

Assignment 8 - I learned how to incorporate arrays into my webpages, especially using user input to populate the array, which will be very useful for forms/series of multiple inputs.

Assignment 9 - I learned how to use javascript to find the date and time for the user, which will be useful for certifying information, such as when querying for time-sensitive information or verifying that a user is on the page at the correct time.

Assignment 10 - This assignment taught me how to effectively create objects, as well as how to utilize objects in efficient ways, using object methods to make overall function easier.

Assignment 11 - DOM and BOM will be very useful for making my HTML webpages dynamic, changing their shape and content in response to the user, especially by adding content as the user inputs information.

Assignment 12 - Using dynamic html, I developed an improved way to display and acquire the information used in assignment 8.

Assignments 13/14 - Using forms and accessing external files will be essential for most websites, since user data will be stored externally and will be needed to pushed/accessed from an external database. Ensuring that inputs are valid will also be vital to making sure that websites don't crash due to bugs.
