WEB 200 SP24

I am taking WEB 200 in order to learn more about web development, specifically how to integrate scripts into your website. Last semester I learned a lot about formatting webpages through HTML and CSS, and delved slightly into inserting interactive javascript code into my webpages, but I hope to become much more experienced through taking this course.

Assignment 1- I established a directory for all of my assignments as well as learned how to have javascript functions output text on HTML webpages.

Assignment 2- I developed more thorough functions that do many calculations using javacsript, and sending their outputs in various places.

Assignment 3- I learned how to take user inputs as my javascript functions.

Assignment 4- I learned how to create input fields in the HTML, and take those inputs and utilize them for my javascript functions, as well as directly display the javascript outputs as text on the website.

Assignment 5- I learned how to incorporate if//else statements into my javascript/html webpages, as well as how to use checkboxes to make my functions perform differently based on whether they are checked or unchecked.
